# HashRBTree-Priority-Flood
Hash Red Black Tree (HRBTree) is a hybrid data structure, integrating the efficient insertion capability of hash tables with the ordered key-value maintenance of the RBTree, thereby reconstructing the priority queue architecture of the priority-flood algorithm. 
HRBTree is available as a performant C++ library, a low-dependency Python package, and a set of command-line tools.
